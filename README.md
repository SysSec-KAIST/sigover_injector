srsLTE
========

[![Coverity Scan Build Status](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/10045/badge.svg)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/10045)

srsLTE is a free and open-source LTE software suite developed by SRS (www.softwareradiosystems.com). 

It includes:
  * srsUE - a complete SDR LTE UE application featuring all layers from PHY to IP
  * srsENB - a complete SDR LTE eNodeB application 
  * srsEPC - a light-weight LTE core network implementation with MME, HSS and S/P-GW
  * a highly modular set of common libraries for PHY, MAC, RLC, PDCP, RRC, NAS, S1AP and GW layers. 

srsLTE is released under the AGPLv3 license and uses software from the OpenLTE project (http://sourceforge.net/projects/openlte) for some security functions and for RRC/NAS message parsing.

srsENB has been tested and validated with the following handsets:
 * LG Nexus 5
 * LG Nexus 4
 * Motorola Moto G4 plus
 * Huawei P9/P9lite
 * Huawei dongles: E3276 and E398

srsEPC Features
---------------

 * Single binary, light-weight LTE EPC implementation with:
   * MME (Mobility Management Entity) with standard S1AP and GTP-U interface to eNB
   * S/P-GW with standard SGi exposed as virtual network interface (TUN device)
   * HSS (Home Subscriber Server) with configurable user database in CSV format

Hardware
--------

The library currently supports the Ettus Universal Hardware Driver (UHD) and the bladeRF driver. Thus, any hardware supported by UHD or bladeRF can be used. There is no sampling rate conversion, therefore the hardware should support 30.72 MHz clock in order to work correctly with LTE sampling frequencies and decode signals from live LTE base stations. 

We have tested the following hardware: 
 * USRP B210
 * USRP X300
 * bladeRF
 * limeSDR (currently, only the PHY-layer examples, i.e., pdsch_enodeb/ue are supported)

Download and build srsLTE: 
```
git clone https://github.com/srsLTE/srsLTE.git
cd srsLTE
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
make test
```

The software suite can also be installed using the command ```sudo make install```. 

Execution Instructions
----------------------

The srsUE, srsENB and srsEPC applications include example configuration files
that should be copied and modified, if needed, to meet the system configuration.
On many systems they should work out of the box. 

Note that you have to execute the applications with root privileges to enable
real-time thread priorities and to permit creation of virtual network interfaces.

Also note that when you run the applications that all additional configuration files,
for example the UE database file needed by srsEPC, reside in your current working directory.
If that is not the case, you may need to specify the location of those files as
command line arguments, for example using the --hss.db_file parameter in srsEPC.

srsENB and srsEPC can run on the same machine as a network-in-the-box configuration.
srsUE needs to run on a separate machine.

If you have installed the software suite using ```sudo make install```, you may just
change in the source directory and start the applications as follows.


### srsEPC

On machine 1, change back to the source directory and copy the srsEPC
config example and UE database file.
```
cd ..
cp srsepc/epc.conf.example srsepc/epc.conf
cp srsepc/user_db.csv.example srsepc/user_db.csv
```

Now, run srsEPC with the default configuration as follows:
```
sudo srsepc srsepc/epc.conf
```

### srsENB

On machine 1, but in another console, change back to the source directory
and copy the main srsENB config example as well as all additional config files for RR, SIB and DRB.

```
cd ..
cp srsenb/enb.conf.example srsenb/enb.conf
cp srsenb/rr.conf.example srsenb/rr.conf
cp srsenb/sib.conf.example srsenb/sib.conf
cp srsenb/drb.conf.example srsenb/drb.conf
```

Now, run the application as follows:
```
sudo srsenb srsenb/enb.conf 
```

### srsUE

On machine 2, after having following the installation instructions above,
change back to the source directory and copy the srsUE example configuration:
```
cd ..
cp srsue/ue.conf.example srsue/ue.conf
```

Now run the srsUE application as follows:
```
sudo srsue srsue/ue.conf
```

Using the default configuration, this creates a virtual network interface
named "tun_srsue" on machine 2 with an IP in the network 172.16.0.x.
Assuming the UE has been assigned IP 172.16.0.2, you may now exchange
IP traffic with machine 1 over the LTE link. For example, run a ping to 
the default SGi IP address:
```
ping 172.16.0.1
```
SigOver manual Common
========
**Prerequisite**
 - Configuration of target eNB. (e.g. by using pdsch_ue of srsLTE)
 - USRP X310 with GPSDO (TCXO or LCXO), (+It’s better to have GPS antenna)
 - Ubuntu 16.04 PC that can execute the srsLTE

**Overall Procedure**
1. Repository “GEN SAMPLE” is for building a subframe with an IMSI paging message.
2. Get configuration of target eNB which the victim UE is connected to. (PHICH Length, PHICH Resources, cyclic prefix, transmission mode, number of ports, number of PRB, PCI)
3. Go to the “lib/test/common/gen_sample.cc” and change cell configurations on with target eNB’s. 
4. Build the project. 
5. Using build/lib/test/common/gen_sample on “GEN SAMPLE”, you can get a file named “output.” 
6. Repository “LTE Injector” is for injecting an IMSI paging message at specific timing and frequency.
7. Build the project.
8. Copy “output” file to sigover_injector/build/lib/examples
9. Using build/lib/examples/pdsch_enodeb, you can inject the IMSI paging message on the air. 

INJECTOR
========

**Building**
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

**Executing**
```
cd lib/examples
cp {where the file "output" from sigover_gen_sample is located}/output .

sudo ./pdsch_enodeb -f @1 -a @2 -p @3 -g @4 -D @5 -i @6
@1: TX frequency (target cell's DL frequency)
@2: SDR option
@3: number of prb
@4: TX gain
@5: Attack mode. sigover_gen_sample generates IMSI paging message. 0 is for IMSI paging.
@6: Input file name. Default is "output"

(example)
sudo ./pdsch_enodeb -f 2120e6 -a clock=gpsdo,type=x300 -p 100 -g 30 -D 0 -i "output"

```
